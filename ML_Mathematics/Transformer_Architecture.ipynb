        "\n",
        "The Transformer model consists of two main parts: the **Encoder** and the **Decoder**. Both are stacks with similar building blocks but are used for different purposes. The encoder are responsible for reading the input and generating representations, while the decoder is used for generating output sequence based on these representations. the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations $(x_1, ..., x_n)$ to a sequence\n",
        "of continuous representations $z = (z_1, ..., z_n)$. Given $z$, the decoder then generates an output\n",
        "sequence $(y_1, ..., y_m)$ of symbols one element at a time.\n",

        "</div>\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Encoder:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The encoder is composed of a stack of $N = 6$ identical layers. Each layer has two\n",
        "sub-layers. The first is a *multi-head self-attention mechanism* and the second is a simple *positionwise fully connected feed-forward network*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism:**\n",
        "  - Self-attention allows each word in a sentence to pay attention to every other words. This machanism calculates the attention score between each pair of words, resulting in a set of attention weights.\n",
        "  - The ''multi-head'' aspect means the self attention mechanism is applied multiple times in parallel, alowing the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different position.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN):**\n",
        " - After the self-attention step, each position's output is passed through a feed-forward neural network. This is applied separately and identically to each position making the network more powerful.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization:**\n",
        "  - Each sub-layer (self-attention and FFNN) in the encoder has a residual connection around it, followed by layer normalization. This helps in stabilizing the training process and prevents vanishing gradients. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\n",
        "  `LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x))`, where `Sublayer(x)` is the function implemented by the sub-layer\n",
        "  itself.\n",
        "  - To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\n",
        "  layers, produce outputs of dimension $d_{model} = 512$.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Decoder:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The decoder is also composed of a stack of $N=6$ identical layers, but each layer has three main components:\n",
        " - **Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism:**\n",
        "  - Similar to the encoder's multi-head self-attention, but with a mask applied to prevent attending to future tokens.  This\n",
        "  masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\n",
        "  predictions for position $i$ can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than $i$. This masking is critical for autoregressive tasks like language generation.\n",
        " - **Multi-Head Attention over Encoder's Output:**\n",
        "   - This layer allows the decoder to attend to all positions in the input sequence, helping it generate accurate outputs based on the entier input context. It uses <span style=\"color:red;\">the encoder's output as \"key\" and \"value\"</span> and <span style=\"color:red;\">the decoder's output as the queries</span>.\n",
        " - **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN):**\n",
        "  - Like in the encoder, a feed-forward network is applied at each position after the multi-head attention layer.\n",
        " - **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization:**\n",
        "  - Similar to the encoder, residual connections and layer normalization are applied to stabilize and normalize the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Positional Encoding:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Transformers do not have sense of the order of words inherently. To capture positional information of words in a sequence, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings. These encodings are based on sine and cosine functions of different friquencies, allowing the model to capture both absolute and relative positions.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Both encoder and decoder takein word embeddings as inputs.\n",
        "- The input embeddings are generated by multiplying the input tokens with an embedding matrix, turning them into dense vectors of dimentions $d_{model}$.\n",
        "- The decoder produces output embeddings that are then passed through a linear layer followed by a softmax function to generate probabilities for the next word in a sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Final Linear and Softmax Layer:**\n",
        "\n",
